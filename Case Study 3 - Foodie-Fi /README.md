## Problem Statement
Danny noticed a gap in the market for a food-focused streaming service similar to Netflix.
Teaming up with partners, he launched Foodie-Fi in 2020, offering monthly and annual subscriptions for exclusive culinary content. 
With a data-driven mindset, Danny ensured that all decisions at Foodie-Fi were guided by insights from subscription data, illustrating its importance in addressing key business questions.

## Available Data
Within the foodie_fi database schema, Danny has provided the following tables for analysis:
* Plans 
* Subscriptions

# Questions
## Customer Journey
### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
* Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

## Challenge Payment Questions
### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
* Monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan.
* Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately.
* Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period.
* Once a customer churns, they will no longer make payments.
* Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
