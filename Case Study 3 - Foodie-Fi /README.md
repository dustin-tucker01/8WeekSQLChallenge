## Problem Statement
Danny noticed a gap in the market for a food-focused streaming service similar to Netflix.
Teaming up with partners, he launched Foodie-Fi in 2020, offering monthly and annual subscriptions for exclusive culinary content. 
With a data-driven mindset, Danny ensured that all decisions at Foodie-Fi were guided by insights from subscription data, illustrating its importance in addressing key business questions.

## Available Data
Within the foodie_fi database schema, Danny has provided the following tables for analysis:
* Plans 
* Subscriptions

# Questions
## Customer Journey
### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
* Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
```sql
WITH cte AS
(SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	plan_name
FROM 
	sample_subscriptions s
JOIN 
	plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
ORDER BY 
	customer_id, 
	s.start_date)
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	ARRAY_TO_STRING(ARRAY_AGG(plan_name),', ') AS customer_journey
FROM 
	cte
GROUP BY 
	customer_id;
-- Each customer's journey can be seen in this result table, with all customers starting with a trial 
-- and then each customer deciding to upgrade their subscription or churn
```
*output*

| customer_id | customer_journey                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 1           | trial, basic monthly             |
| 2           | trial, pro annual                |
| 11          | trial, churn                     |
| 13          | trial, basic monthly, pro monthly|
| 15          | trial, pro monthly, churn        |
| 16          | trial, basic monthly, pro annual |
| 18          | trial, pro monthly               |
| 19          | trial, pro monthly, pro annual   |

## Data Analysis Questions
### How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM 
	subscriptions;
```
*output*

| total_customers |
|-----------------|
| 1000            |

### What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset? 
* This query effectively includes the year, month, and the number of trial plan start dates within that month and year
* I did this query in this manner to allow for the use of this same query as the business gains trial plans into 2021. 
```sql
WITH months_years AS ( -- creating the base table for all 12 months for the years that are present in the dataset
    SELECT 
        y.year AS year, 
        TO_CHAR(x, 'Month') AS month 
    FROM 
        generate_series('2024-01-01'::DATE, '2024-12-01'::DATE, '1 Month') x
    CROSS JOIN 
        (SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) AS year FROM subscriptions) y
    ORDER BY 
        y.year, x
), 
monthly_distributions AS ( -- getting the number of trial plan start dates grouped by year and month
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) AS year, 
        TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') AS month, 
        COUNT(start_date) AS trials
    FROM 
        subscriptions
    WHERE 
        plan_id = 0
    GROUP BY 
        year, 
        TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month')
)
SELECT -- final table 
    o.year, 
    o.month, 
    m.trials
FROM 
    monthly_distributions m
RIGHT JOIN 
    months_years o ON m.year = o.year AND m.month = o.month;
-- joining the base table to the distributions present in the dataset to include months with no trial plan start dates

```

## Challenge Payment Questions
### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
* Monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan.
* Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately.
* Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period.
* Once a customer churns, they will no longer make payments.
* Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
